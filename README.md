Intruder Selfie app makes your phone takes a picture every time you unlock your
phone.

You can enable and disable the background service
by clicking the button. After you enable it your phone will take a picture everytime you unlock your
phone. The picture will be saved in Pictures\iSelfie directory in your phone storage. I use the front
camera to take the picture because with front camera you can take a picture of your face or your

friends when they unlock your phone. This app uses 2 permissions: camera and writes to external
storage.

This app use Service and BroadcastReceiver.
